3. dirname is used to return the directory portion of the pathname, while basename is used to return the filename of the pathname.  For example, if you have a file /home/test/ABC.txt, then if you type ‘dirname /home/test/ABC.txt’, it would simply return /home/test/.  If you type ‘basename /home/test/ABC.txt’ it would simply return ABC.txt.
